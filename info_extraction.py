# 🔍 Email pattern using regex:
# Explanation:
# \b                    = word boundary (to avoid matching inside other words)
# [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+     = username part (can include letters, numbers, dots, etc.)
# @                     = mandatory "@" symbol
# [a-zA-Z0-9.-]+        = domain name (can include letters, numbers, hyphens)
# \.                    = dot before domain extension
# [a-zA-Z]{2,}          = domain extension (like com, org, co.uk — must be at least 2 letters)
# \b                    = end word boundary
